NOTES:

Loginpanel.app is not currently ready for full use.   It is getting closer
as there are only a few things left to fo.  The application is intended for use on
Linux systems w/ the GNUstep libraries installed.  Although I see no reason
why it shouldn't run on other UNIX or UNIX-like systems using GNUstep.

System Requirements:
Linux, gscrypt, GNUstep

to use PAM for authentication, run make like:
make have-pam=yes


Change History
11/2000

NSTextField commited to repository.  I need to wait
for further updates in the NSLayoutManager/
GSSimpleLayoutManager code before I can add the 
echoes bullets feature, but it works for now.

The only thing which needs to be done to make
the application of practical use is to find a 
way to install it so that it will work prior to
anyone being logged in to the machine.

10/2000

I am making some progress on the fixes for 
NSSecureTextField.  I believe I should have it 
working sometime soon.

8/2000

The application is getting closer and closer
to completion.  Authentication using PAM now works
under GNUstep on Linux.   It seems as though the
only real obstacle to getting it working completely
is the fact that NSSecureTextField doesn't work.

3/2000

This application is not ready for primetime yet.
It is mostly experimental at this stage.  The
reason I am releasing it now is to let those who
are interested play with it.

It seems to work under OPENSTEP4.2/Mach, at the
moment.  It does everything I expect it too.
It seems to only partially work under GNUstep.
I believe this has something to do with how
the gmodel file is being translated.
